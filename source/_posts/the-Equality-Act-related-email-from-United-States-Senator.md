（转自FB）：For what it’s worth, I attempted to write to Senator Feinstein re: the Equality Act. She made sure to make clear that she is not only the co-sponsor but also the Ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where it is awaiting consideration. 
Call any and all of the Senators you can (including Mitch McConnels office) to make sure this doesn’t pass. 
 
Dear Braley:
 
Thank you for writing to express your opposition to the “Equality Act.”  I appreciate the time you took to write, and I welcome the opportunity to respond. 
 
While I appreciate hearing your thoughts on this matter, I am afraid this is an issue on which we must disagree.  I believe all people deserve the right to be treated equally, evaluated on their individual merits, and not subject to discrimination because of who they are or whom they love. 
 
For that reason, I am a cosponsor of the “Equality Act” (S. 788), which was introduced by Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) on March 13, 2019.  This bill would amend a number of civil rights laws to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, public accommodations, credit, jury service, and Federal financial assistance.  S. 788 currently awaits consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which I am the Ranking Member.  
 
While we must agree to disagree on this issue, I hope there are many more issues on which we do agree. 
 
Once again, thank you for writing.  Should you have any other questions or comments, please call my Washington, D.C., office at (202) 224-3841 or visit my website at feinstein.senate.gov.  You can also follow me online at YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, and you can sign up for my email newsletter at feinstein.senate.gov/newsletter.
 
Best regards.

Sincerely yours,

  Dianne Feinstein
         United States Senator
