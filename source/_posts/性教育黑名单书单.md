> 今天收到图书馆的邮件,说6月份是 pride month,还给发了一份关于lgb的书单,我整理了一下,一共40本,23本 picture book,都是给preschool到3年级的小朋友看的

> 我给整理成黑名单了供大家参考,以免误借。有些书隐蔽性特别大,他不说我都不知道是讲这个的。

## 家长的讨论

> 从Preschool下手的图画书就是这么多！真是用心叵测啊[衰]

> 无孔不入的洗脑。。。小说。。非小说。。

> 核桃家長說要輪流從圖書館借出，hold它到個極限，藏起來，綠化圖書館[偷笑]

> 那么多开心变变变变变书给孩子们非常有兴趣的看真是邪恶痛心[大哭][大哭]

> （Lin-K-Vejar家长整理，分享心得）：像里面worm loves worm，还有crayon story，封面画的都特别可爱，看名字也看不出是讲这个的，tango makes 3，画了三只小企鹅，我觉得很容易误借啊，作者名字我都加粗了，他们的其他书也要留心。

> 请大家收藏上面的书单，这些尽量避免给孩子们看，大人可以详细查阅该书单和里面的内容，确实隐蔽性很大。
